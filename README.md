# Movie-Recommedation-System
In today's world, with technological advancements, we are all surrounded with multiple recommendation systems. This list starts from YouTube and goes up till Netflix and many other fashion and music related apps. One such recommendation system was implemented by me for recommending movies.

Here I used the onlie dataset with all the movie names and genre of every movie. I found similar movies with the help of K Nearest Neaighbors algorithm built to find shortest distance between 2 points and provide with similar content from the same category.
